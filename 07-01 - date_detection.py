# Date Detection
# Write a regular expression that can detect dates in the DD/MM/YYYY format.
# Assume that the days range from 01 to 31, the months range from 01 to 12,
# and the years range from 1000 to 2999.
# Note that if the day or month is a single digit, itâ€™ll have a leading zero.
#
# The regular expression doesnâ€™t have to detect correct days for each month or for leap years;
# it will accept nonexistent dates like 31/02/2020 or 31/04/2021.
# Then store these strings into variables named month, day, and year, and write additional code that can detect if it is a valid date.
# April, June, September, and November have 30 days, February has 28 days, and the rest of the months have 31 days.
# February has 29 days in leap years. Leap years are every year evenly divisible by 4, except for years evenly divisible by 100,
# unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400. Note how this calculation makes it impossible to make a
# reasonably sized regular expression that can detect a valid date.
